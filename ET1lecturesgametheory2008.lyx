Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section aims to present essential tools for predicting players' actions
 in a range of strategic situations.
 By order of complexity, we will study strategic form games, where players
 choose actions at the same time so there is no conditioning of actions
 based on the action of others, extensive form games where players choose
 actions in succession but know what action was taken by others previously
 so there is no uncertainty, and finally Bayesian games where players choose
 action in succession but are not certain what the other played previously.
 We will also cover repeated games under full information, where players
 condition their action on their observation of what was played in a previous
 stage of the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lecture builds on the analysis of one single game, a coordination game,
 which is made progressively more complex so as to introduce new concepts.
 Those include the concept of dominant strategy, Nash equilibrium, mixed
 strategy Nash equilibrium, backward induction, subgame perfect Nash equilibrium
, Bayesian Nash equilibrium and forward induction.
 A few other games are introduced, includings games of auctions (to illustrate
 the use of Bayesian Nash equilibrium concepts) and the Prisoners' dilemma
 (in relation to infinitely repeated games).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This lecture does not introduce many applications of game theory, as it
 is expected the student will encounter applications relevant to his or
 her area of specialization further on in the course of his or her MSc.
 Rather, the lecture aims to give good mastery of notations and techniques
 for solving a wide range of games.

Dominance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following definitions introduce the concept of a strictly dominant strategy
 equilibrium.
 In a strictly dominant strategy equilibrium, players play their strategy
 irrespective of the action of others.

 Strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}\in S_{i}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 strictly dominates another strategies 
\begin_inset Formula $s'_{i}$
\end_inset

, then that strategy is strictly dominated and can be eliminated from considerat

 Strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is strictly dominated if there is an 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}\in S_{i}$
\end_inset

 that strictly dominates it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 strictly dominates all other strategies, then it is strictly dominant.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 is by definition unique.

\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}^{\prime}\neq s_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
An equilibrium in strictly dominant strategies exists if all players have
 a strictly dominant strategy.
 Note that from the above, a strictly dominant strategy is necessarily unique.

Definition:
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{\ast}\in S$
\end_inset

 is a strictly dominant strategy equilibrium if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}(s_{i}^{\ast},s_{-i})>u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i})$
\end_inset

 for all players 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in N$
\end_inset

 and for all strategy profiles 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{-i}\in S_{-i},$
\end_inset

 that is, if all elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 are strictly dominant strategies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Example:
\emph default
 The strictly dominant strategy equilibrium in the Prisoners' Dilemma is
 {D,D}.
 Indeed, D is a strictly dominant strategy for player 1 as 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}(D,C)>u_{1}(C,C)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}(D,D)>u_{1}(C,D)$
\end_inset

.
 The same holds for player 
\begin_inset Formula $2.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Remark:
\emph default
 One can also define weak dominance as follows: Strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}\in S_{i}$
\end_inset

 weakly dominates (or simply 
\begin_inset Quotes grd
\end_inset

dominates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}^{\prime}\neq s_{i}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

 for player 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i})\geq u_{i}(s_{i}^{\prime},s_{-i})$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{-i}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{-i}.$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Iterated delection of strictly dominated strategies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}^{\prime}$

 that is strictly dominated will not be part of any equilibrium of the game.
 One can therefore exclude strictly dominated strategies from the set of
 available strategies.

Games with a strictly dominant strategy equilibrium are of limited interest.
 Indeed, in so far as players' actions are not dependent on others' action,
 those games cannot properly be called strategic.

 which is of interest in proper strategic games.

) is a strategy profile 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 such that for every player 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}(s_{i}^{\ast},s_{-i}^{\ast})\geq u_{i}(s_{i},s_{-i}^{\ast})$

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}\in S_{i}.$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

 the NE concept does not require that 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 be dominant for all 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{-i}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{-i},$
\end_inset

 but only for 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{-i}^{\ast}$

\emph on
taking 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{-i}^{\ast}$

Note how we found two Nash equilibria of the game above.
 This generalizes to saying that Nash equilibria are not necessarily unique,
 unlike dominant strategy equilibria.
 However, from the definition, one can check that any dominant strategy
 equilibrium is also a Nash equilibrium.
 There is no way in the game above to choose which of the Nash equilibria
 is more likely to be chosen.
 However, the Nash equilibrium concept allows one to say that players will
 play either one or the other Nash equilibria.
 The Nash equilibria we found are such that players choose actions in a
 deterministic way, that is, if for example the Nash equilibrium is {C,C},
 then both players play C.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, we consider the possibility for players to choose actions
 at random according to pre-defined probabilities.
 For the sake of easy modeling, we assume agents have access to a randomizing
 device (such as a coin for example), which allows them to randomize over
 their actions.
 For example, an agent who decides to play C with probability 1/8 in the
 game above can do so by saying he will play C whenever three throws of
 the coin all give out 
\begin_inset Quotes els
\end_inset

tail
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

.
 We will see later whether agents can randomize in an accurate and rational
 way without access to such a randomizing device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 Consider thus strategies 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the form: 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and play 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-p_{i}.$
\end_inset

 Strategy 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be denoted in short as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}.$
\end_inset

 Suppose players 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 play strategies 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{F}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 The payoff to 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 of playing 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{F}(C,p_{B})=4p_{B}+1(1-p_{B})=3p_{B}+1.$
\end_inset

 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{F}(P,p_{B})=3-3p_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 I also obtain that 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{B}(p_{F},C)=3p_{F}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $u_{B}(p_{F},P)=p_{F}+4(1-p_{F})=4-3p_{F}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{B}<\frac{1}{3}$

 Similarly,

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $3p_{F}>4-3p_{F},$

\end_inset

 and will be indifferent between the two actions whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{F}=\frac{2}{3}.$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One thus has three Nash equilibria: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ p_{F}=0,p_{B}=0\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ p_{F}=1,p_{B}=1\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 whereby each player plays its own favorite option with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{3},$
\end_inset

 and the other option with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}.$
\end_inset

 Under that MSNE, the payoff for 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $2$

 is a good introduction to the debate over whether agents are actually able
 to play mixed strategies.
 This is particularly important when the only NE is in mixed strategies,
 as in the game under study in the article (penalty strikes).
 Most of the evidence in experimental settings is not encouraging (agents
 find it difficult to choose actions randomly).
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Palacios-Huerta2003"

\end_inset

 shows that professional footballers, who have sufficient experience and
 incentives, appear to be able to use mixed strategies in their choice of
 which side of the goal to strike a ball.

\begin_layout Standard
As in the above, the usual way to find equilibria of an extensive form game
 is to reduce it to a normal form game and find the NE of that normal form
 game.
 The equilibria of the extensive form game will be a subset of the NE of
 the normal form game, as the normal form game neglects important information
 about the succesion of actions in the game.
 We see below how the set of Nash equilibria can be parsed down through
 a process of 
\emph on
backward induction
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Backward induction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the above, the entrant stays out because she expects the incumbent
 to fight upon entry with probability at least half.
 However, since the entrant stays out, this is a completely arbitrary belief
 as there is no way for the entrant to verify that prediction.
 Is that arbitrary belief reasonable? When the entrant enters, then the
 incumbent will always find it best to accomodate.
 Therefore, the only credible belief for the entrant is that when the entrant
 enters, then the incumbent would accomodate.
 Therefore, it is not reasonable for the incumbent to believe that the incumbent
 would fight with any positive probability if she were to enter, because
 it is not credible for the incumbent to actually fight upon entry.
 One can thus state that the only credible equilibria of the game are those
 that survive a process of backward induction where, beginning from the
 last stage, actions that players will not choose in that stage are eliminated
 from consideration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, in the game of entry deterrence, the incumbent will not fight
 when called upon to choose its action.
 Eliminating 
\begin_inset Quotes els
\end_inset

fight upon entry
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

 from consideration, the game that remains is thus a choice for the entrant
 between staying out, which gives payoff 
\begin_inset Formula $0,$
\end_inset

 and entering, which, by backward induction, will give a payoff of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.$
\end_inset

 The entrant thus chooses to enter.
 The only equilibrium that survives this process of backward induction is
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \text{Enter, Accomodate}\right\} .$

 A singleton information set is such that a player knows the history of

 A subgame is a game that follows a singleton information set.
 A game can have many subgames, and a subgame can have subgames as well.

 In the Prisoners' Dilemma, no one of the players knows what the other player
 played so there is no subgame over than the whole game which follows from
 history

\end_inset

.
 In the entry deterrence game, the incumbent, once it is its turn to play,
 knows the entrant entered.
 Therefore, the game after entry where the incumbent has to choose whether
 to enter or not is a subgame.
 The entry deterrence game has two subgames: the one that follows from history

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
In all those cases, the SPNE coincides with the NE obtained by backward

 with certainty the history that led to the current stage in the game when
 it is their turn to play.

 However, he does not know if she went to the pub or to the café.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the payoff for 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 of staying at home makes her willing to go out only if her preferred PSNE
 obtains, but not anytime else (when the other PSNE is played, or when the
 MSNE is played).
 Intuitively, this means she will go out only if she believes the British
 player will go to the café, in which case she goes to the café, so the
 British player should go to the café if he realizes she went out.
 We are going to see if this intuition is borne out in the following process
 of finding out reasonable equilibria of the game:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This game that has three subgames, the one starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \emptyset\right\} $
\end_inset

 (the whole game), the one starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \text{Home}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and the one starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \text{Out}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 As seen before, there are two PSNE of the subgame starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \text{Out}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as well as one MSNE.
 Consider thus all possible SPNE candidates once only NE of the subgame
 starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \text{Out}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are retained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ (Home,Caf\acute{e}),Caf\acute{e}\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ (Home,Pub),Pub\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ (Home,\frac{2}{3}),\frac{1}{3}\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ (Out,Pub),Pub\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ (Out,Caf\acute{e}),Caf\acute{e}\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ (Out,\frac{2}{3}),\frac{1}{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, for example in the first case, while F stays home, we still express
 what would happen if she did not.
 Backward induction eliminates the first potential equilibrium: if 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 expects 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ Caf\acute{e},Caf\acute{e}\right\} $
\end_inset

 to be played in the subgame starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ Out\right\} ,$
\end_inset

 then she would go out.
 In the same way, the fourth and the sixth equilibrium can be eliminated
 as well: if she expects {Pub,Pub} to be played in the subgame starting
 at Out, then she is better off staying in.
 2, 3 and 5 are thus the only SPNE of the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to select among those, one will have to refine the concept of a
 SPNE by using a process of 
\emph on
forward induction
\emph default
: the second equilibrium would require 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to think that when 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 goes out, she goes to the pub, which would not be rational of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 since she would have done better staying home in that case.
 Similarly, the third equilibrium requires 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to think 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 plays a mixed strategy that obtains payoff of 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, even though in that case she would have done better staying at home.
 The only equilibrium that thus survives forward induction is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ (Out,Caf\acute{e}),Caf\acute{e}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 In that equilibrium, F does not wish she could change any of her action
 at any stage of the game (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 once at the café, she is happy to have gone out).
 This confirms our intuition as stated at the beginning of the analysis
 of this game.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
At this stage, we can define the process of forward induction:

Forward induction:

 To the difference of backward induction that starts from the end of the

 forward induction starts from the beginning of the game and assumes that
 present behavior is optimal given what is expected to happen later.
 An equilibrium will survive the process of backward induction when it is
 such that the behavior of a player proves to have been optimal given the
 succeding strategies played in the game.

 uses forward induction to restrict the set of NE by eliminating those that
 are based on unreasonable out-of-equilibrium beliefs, i.e.
 those out-of-equilibrium beliefs that imply a player would play against
 his or her own interest if players deviated from the equilibrium.
 The problem with this approach is that, since actions that are out of equilibri
um are not played, there is in principle nothing that could restrict the
 beliefs of someone once they are played.
 In fact, it may be rational to believe that a player that plays out of
 equilibrium is actually irrational, and thus hold out any beliefs about
 how he might play or what are his beliefs!

Bayesian Games
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Bayesian game differs from a game with imperfect information in that,
 while in games with imperfect information the players may not know what
 was played before, in Bayesian games players may not know who they are
 playing against.
 In practice, this means they will not know what the other player will play
 in advance of the game, which is quite different from not being perfectly
 informed of what is played during the game.
 Before going on to define further what is a Bayesian game, let us study
 a specific Bayesian game, extended from our usual Coordination Game:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: The British person likes the French person with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2},$
\end_inset

 and dislikes her with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}.$
\end_inset

 The British person knows his own type, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{l}$
\end_inset

 (likes) or 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{h}$
\end_inset

 (hates).
 The British person is very private and does not display his feelings openly,
 so the French person does not know the type of the British person and assigns
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 to the British person liking her.
\end_layout

 Player 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 play the same role in the game.

\end_inset

 there is a set 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 of possible actions, labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}.$

 This means that whatever 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

\begin_layout Enumerate
Beliefs, for each pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,t_{i}),$

 a probability distribution over

 written 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(t_{-i}|t_{i}).$

Remark:

 Beliefs are the beliefs of each player of each different type over the
 possible types of each other player.
 In the previous game, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 believed 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 could be of two types, 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $h,$
\end_inset

 with equal probability.
 Since there was only one type of 
\begin_inset Formula $F,$
\end_inset

 one did not need to specify different beliefs for different types of 
\begin_inset Formula $F.$

 Also, both 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{l}$

\begin_inset Formula $B_{h}$

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, we consider two Bayesian games and find their Nash Equilibria.
 The first example is designed to show that if players differ in their types,
 then even though each type of players play pure strategies, what is observed
 by an external observer are mixed strategies.
 The second example considers auction mechanisms, where we show that auctions
 can be used as a tool to get players to reveal their own type.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the following Bayesian strategy, such that

\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 s.t.

 This is a very simple kind of threshold strategy whereby depending on their

\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $B.$
\end_inset

 Note that this is a considerable simplification from for example assuming
 that

 would vary the probability with which he would play 
\begin_inset Formula $C$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

 depending on his type.
 Here, he plays pure strategies, either 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $C$

 However, from the perspective of 
\begin_inset Formula $B,$
\end_inset

 the probability that 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{a-f^{\ast}}{a}$

\end_inset

 is then

 Therefore, while players play pure strategies depending on their type,
 this is observationaly equivalent to mixed strategies from the point of

Similarly, the best strategy for 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 of type 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is to play 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\frac{f^{\ast}}{a})3>(1-\frac{f^{\ast}}{a})(1+b)+\frac{f^{\ast}}{a}(4+b),$

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $C$

\begin_layout Standard
Both players are indifferent between playing 
\begin_inset Formula $C$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $f=f^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=b^{\ast},$
\end_inset

 which leads to the following system of equations:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
f^{\ast} & =2-6\frac{b^{\ast}}{a}\\
b^{\ast} & =2-6\frac{f^{\ast}}{a}
\end{align*}

\begin_inset Formula $f^{\ast}=b^{\ast}=\frac{2a}{6+a}.$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Itemize
From the point of view of 
\begin_inset Formula $F,$
\end_inset

 the probability that 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 goes to the pub is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pr(b\geq\frac{2a}{6+a})=1-\frac{2}{6+a}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From the point of view of 
\begin_inset Formula $B,$
\end_inset

 the probability that 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 goes to the café is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pr(f\geq\frac{2a}{6+a})=1-\frac{2}{6+a}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One will notice that as 
\begin_inset Formula $a\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 (uncertainty disappears), then each player can expect the other player
 to play her preferred choice with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{3}$
\end_inset

, which corresponds to the MSNE of the game.
 This means that `purification' of the pure-strategy Bayesian equilibrium
 of this game resembles the MSNE of the unperturbed game.
 Note however that the PSNE of the unperturbed game are also Bayesian equilibria
 of the perturbed game.
 This means that purification of pure-strategy Nash equilibria does not
 exclude any NE of the original game with no uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Auctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Auctions are a specific example of Bayesian games, whereby one or many buyers
 and one or many sellers must reach an agreement over the exchange of one
 or many goods.
 This agreement may be about exchange price, quantity exchanged, and the
 identity and allocation to sellers and buyers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will examine two very simple mechanisms: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One is such that a seller must decide to which of two buyers to sell one
 indivisible good in its possession, and at what price.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The other is such that one buyer is faced with one seller with one indivisible
 good, and must reach an agreement over the price at which that one indivisible
 good will be exchanged.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a variety of auction mechanisms which could be applied to either
 of the two situations, and there are also a variety of other situations
 where auction mechanisms could be applied.
 We will examine only the first price sealed bid auction as applied to the
 first situation, and the double auction as applied to the second situation.

\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}(v_{i}).$

\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}(b_{i};v_{i})=\begin{cases}

\ensuremath{v_{i}-b_{i}\text{ if }b_{i}>b_{j}}
\end{tabular}\end{cases}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are going to looks for a linear bidding strategy, s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}(v_{i})=\alpha+\beta v_{i}.$
\end_inset

 Neglecting the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}=b_{j}$
\end_inset

 (an event of probability measure 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

), and assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}\in\lbrack\alpha,\alpha+\beta],$
\end_inset

 the expected payoff to player 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 who is bidding 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E(u_{j}(b_{j};v_{j})) & =\Pr(b_{j}\geq\alpha+\beta v_{i})(v_{j}-b_{j})\\
 & =\Pr(\frac{b_{j}-\alpha}{\beta}\geq v_{i})(v_{j}-b_{j})\\
 & =\frac{b_{j}-\alpha}{\beta}(v_{j}-b_{j})
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 This is a concave function which attains a maximum for 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}=\frac{v_{j}+\alpha}{2}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

 indeed chooses

\begin_inset Formula

 & =\Pr(2b_{i}-\alpha\geq v_{j})(v_{i}-b_{i})\\
 & =(2b_{i}-\alpha)(v_{i}-b_{i})
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 This is a concave function that attains its maximum for 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}=\frac{\alpha+2v_{i}}{4}.$
\end_inset

 Combining the two equations for 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\text{j}}$
\end_inset

, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0$

 Each bidder thus bids half his/her own valuation for the good.

\begin_layout Standard
A buyer with valuation 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{b}\sim U[0,1]$
\end_inset

 for a good is faced with a seller with valuation 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{s}\sim U[0,1]$
\end_inset

 for a good.
 Both have to submit their bids (offered price for the buyer, asked price
 for the seller), simultaneously.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{b}<p_{s}$
\end_inset

 then there is no trade.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{b}\geq p_{s},$
\end_inset

 then they split the difference, so the trade price is 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\frac{p_{s}+p_{b}}{2}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Payoffs are thus as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Formula $u_{b}(p_{b};v_{b})=\begin{cases}
\begin{tabular}{c}
 \ensuremath{0\text{ if }p_{b}<p_{s}}\\
\ensuremath{v_{b}-\frac{p_{s}+p_{b}}{2}\text{ if }p_{b}\geq p_{s}}
\end{tabular}\end{cases}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Formula $u_{s}(p_{s};v_{s})=\begin{cases}
\begin{tabular}{c}
 \ensuremath{0\text{ if }p_{b}<p_{s}}\\
\ensuremath{\frac{p_{s}+p_{b}}{2}-v_{s}\text{ if }p_{b}\geq p_{s}}
\end{tabular}\end{cases}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, one will consider linear bidding strategies s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{b}(v_{b})=\alpha+\beta v_{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{s}(v_{s})=\gamma+\delta v_{s}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the strategy of the buyer.
 The expected payoff to the buyer who is offering 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{b}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E(u_{b}(p_{b};v_{b}))=\Pr(p_{b}\geq p_{s})(v_{b}-\frac{E(p_{s}\mid p_{b}\geq p_{s})+p_{b}}{2})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E(p_{s}\text{ }|\text{ }p_{b} & \geq p_{s})=E(\gamma+\delta v_{s}\mid p_{b}\geq\gamma+\delta v_{s})\\
 & =\gamma+\delta E(v_{s}\mid\frac{p_{b}-\gamma}{\delta}\geq v_{s})\\
 & =\gamma+\delta\frac{p_{b}-\gamma}{2\delta}\\
 & =\frac{1}{2}\gamma+\frac{1}{2}p_{b}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 so
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
E(u_{b}(p_{b};v_{b})) & =\Pr(\frac{p_{s}-\gamma}{\delta}\geq v_{s})(v_{b}-\frac{\frac{1}{2}\gamma+\frac{1}{2}p_{b}+p_{b}}{2})\\
 & =\frac{p_{b}-\gamma}{\delta}(v_{b}-\frac{\gamma+3p_{b}}{4})
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 This is a concave function that is maximized for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{b}=\frac{\gamma+2v_{b}}{3}.$
\end_inset

 Similarly, the optimal bidding strategy for the seller is to ask 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{s}=\frac{\alpha+\beta+2v_{s}}{3}.$
\end_inset

 Combining the two equations for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{s}$
\end_inset

 with the assumed expression of their value, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\delta=\frac{2}{3}.$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\frac{\gamma}{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{3}.$
\end_inset

 This is solved for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\frac{1}{12}.$
\end_inset

 This means that both buyer and seller will 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shade
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 their valuation by a factor of 2/3 and there is a range of values of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{b}$
\end_inset

 for which no trade ever takes place.

 Find all its Nash Equilibria.

\begin_layout Description
Answer: This game has two PSNEs, 
\begin_inset Formula $(T,L)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(M,C)$
\end_inset

.
 It also has mixed strategy equilibria as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Suppose player 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 mixes between 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $l,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-c-l$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Then expected payoffs for 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 can written as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u_{1}(T) & =3l+5(1-c-l)\\
u_{1}(M) & =2l+c+3(1-c-l)\\
u_{1}(B) & =l+4(1-c-l)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 and one can see that 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}(T)>u_{1}(B)$
\end_inset

 so player 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 never plays 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 if player 2 plays a mixed strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now player 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 who mixes between 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Then expected payoffs for 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 can be written as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u_{2}(L) & =t+m\\
u_{1}(C) & =2m\\
u_{1}(R) & =m
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 would play 
\begin_inset Formula $L,$
\end_inset

 while if 
\begin_inset Formula $m>0,$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}(C)>u_{1}(R),$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is never played in a mixed strategy equilibrium.
 One is thus left with the following game to examine in order to find MSNEs
 of this game:

Answer: Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

's conditional strategy such that if 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the first stage, 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 in the second stage, and if 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in the first stage, 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in the second stage.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This strategy can be explained as such: 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 in the first stage, hoping that 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 will play 
\begin_inset Formula $B.$
\end_inset

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 indeed, then he is rewarded by 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 playing 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 in the second stage, when 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 will play 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and get 
\begin_inset Formula $3.$
\end_inset

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 instead (best response to 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

), then he is punished by 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 playing 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in the second stage, when 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 will play 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and get only 
\begin_inset Formula $1.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 will conform to 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

's expectations whenever the discounted payoff to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 under this equilibrium, 
\begin_inset Formula $4+3\delta$
\end_inset

 is more than the deviation payoff of 
\begin_inset Formula $5+\delta$
\end_inset

.
 This is true for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\geq1/2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, suppose that as under this equilibrium, 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the first stage.
 Then the best response for 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 is to play 
\begin_inset Formula $R.$
\end_inset

 There is thus no incentive under this equilibrium for 2 to deviate from
 the first stage action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, there is a PSNE of the two-stage game such that: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 in the first stage, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 played 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the first stage, then 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 in the second stage (so 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in the second stage).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 played 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in the first stage then 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in the second stage (so 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 plays 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 in the second stage).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equilibrium is supported for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\geq1/2.$
\end_inset

 One can check there is no incentive for players to deviate from its prescribed
 course of action.

Since

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $(B,X)$
\end_inset

 cannot be supported in the first stage of a two stage game (see

 Now, the minimum

\begin_inset Formula $4+2\delta+2\delta^{2}+2\delta^{3}+\ldots2\delta^{N-1}\geq9$
\end_inset

 If this is supported for

\end_inset

 Now, 
\begin_inset Formula $4+2+2+2>9>4+2+2$

\begin_layout Standard
The one-stage PSNE of this game is 
\begin_inset Formula $(D,D).$
\end_inset

 This is the unique NE of this game.
 Consider now a finitely repeated game of this stage game, with end period
 
\begin_inset Formula $T.$
\end_inset

 One can check that by backward induction, the only SPNE of this stage game
 is to play 
\begin_inset Formula $(D,D)$
\end_inset

 in all periods.
 Does this translate into the infinitely repeated version of the prisoners'
 dilemma game? One will see that under some conditions on the discount factor,
 the outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $(C,C)$
\end_inset

 can be obtained in every stages of the repeated game if 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is infinite.

The Nash-Threats Folk Theorem

\begin_layout Description
Nash-Threats

\series bold
Folk Theorem:
\series default
 Every payoffs within the convex hull that are higher than the Nash equilibrium
 payoff profile for both players can be achieved as a SPNE of the infinitely
 repeated game subject to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 being high enough.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Remark: Note the proviso that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 be high enough.
 This means that some payoffs that may be achieved for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 may not be achievable for some lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

, and conversely.
 There are thus two ways to apply the theorem: either see what is the maximum
 payoff that may be achieved for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

, or see what level of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is needed to attain a given payoff.

The convex hull minus its hashed areas is the set of attainable payoffs.
 We will see below how such payoffs may be achieved.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Example: In the PD under study, let us for example study how the payoff
 
\begin_inset Formula $(5,5)$
\end_inset

 can be attained.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Consider the following `tit-for-tat' conditional stage game strategy: Play
 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in the first period.
 In the 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{th}$
\end_inset

 period, and if the other player played 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in all previous periods, then play 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 as well.
 If the other player played 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 in any of the previous periods, then play 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Playing 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 will then be optimal only if in all previous periods both players always
 played 
\begin_inset Formula $C,$
\end_inset

 and if playing 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in this period obtains higher payoff than playing 
\begin_inset Formula $D.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us see therefore what is the payoff to playing 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

: If one plays 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 in this period, then one makes 
\begin_inset Formula $7$
\end_inset

 this period, and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 in all subsequent periods.
 If one plays 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in this period, then one will also play 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in the next period (the incentives are the same next period as in this
 period), so the expected payoff of playing 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 this period is 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 forever.
 Therefore, playing 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 this period is optimal s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
5+5\delta+5\delta^{2}+5\delta^{3}+....=\frac{5}{1-\delta}\geq7+\frac{\delta}{1-\delta}
\]

\end_inset

 which translates in 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta\geq\frac{1}{3}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As claimed in the theorem, one can attain payoff 
\begin_inset Formula $(5,5)$
\end_inset

, which is inside the convex hull and more than what is obtained in the
 NE of the stage game for both agents, s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 high enough, in this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\geq\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Extension: Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta<\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

.
 What is the maximum payoff that can be attained? The theorem tells us that
 a payoff within the non-shaded area in the convex hull on the graph above
 can be attained, but how, and what payoff?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The `how' is rather complicated, and involves assuming that players have
 access to publicly observable randomizing devices so that for example,
 they know when to play 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and when to play 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

.
 This public randomizing device would draw their strategy at random according
 to pre-determined probabilities.
 It would be possible for either player to check the other player played
 what they were supposed to play.
 We can prove that the greatest payoff that may be achieved subject to a
 given 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is such that both players play symmetric strategies, i.e.
 both play C with the same probability.
 The probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 with which both 1 and 2 are asked to play C determines their payoff 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, I will have 
\begin_inset Formula $a=5p^{2}+7p(1-p)+(1-p)^{2}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1 will not deviate from playing C when told to do so s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $5p+\delta\frac{a}{1-\delta}\geq7p+1(1-p)+\frac{\delta}{1-\delta}$
\end_inset

 (the constraint for 2 is the same).
 I can thus conclude, replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 by its expression in 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and rewriting the above equation, that I will need that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 be set such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{a-1}{1+p}\geq\frac{1-\delta}{\delta}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that, as stated previously, for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\geq\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

 and full cooperation can be sustained.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

, no cooperation is sustainable (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0)$
\end_inset

.
