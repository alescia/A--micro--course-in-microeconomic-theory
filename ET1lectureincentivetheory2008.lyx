Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this lecture, we consider situations with asymmetric information.
 A principal is faced with an agent with whom he has to enter into a contractual
 relationship.
 He does not know either the level of ability of the agent (adverse selection,
 whereby inept agents are mixed with able ones) or he cannot control the
 level of effort expended by the agent into the delivery of the contracted
 performance (moral hazard then arises from the part of the agent, who may
 be tempted to slack).
 Issues such as those give rise to incentive (or contract) theory, whose
 aim is to examine how best to organize the principal-agent relationship
 in contexts of asymmetric information.
 Domains of application for contract theory are outlined, and some typical
 agency problems are presented, as well as their solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asymmetric information is different from imperfect information.
 Instead of all agents on the market holding the same set of (possibly imperfect
) information on every other agents in the market, some agents know more
 than others.
 Information that can be found out at some cost is not asymmetric information.
 Asymmetric information arises when agents are not motivated to reveal informati
on they hold, for example because that information provides them with some
 advantage in a relationship.
 We will see how a principal can set up contractual relationships such as
 to motivate the agent to reveal that information, at some cost to the principal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many different types of asymmetric information.
 Asymmetric information on the type of the agent leads to adverse selection
 problems.
 In that setting, for example, the fact you are healthy or not depends on
 outside factors and not on your habits.
 Asymmetric information on the effort of the players leads to moral hazard.
 In that case, for example, the fact you are healthy or not depends on your
 habits.
 In the first case, you will want to screen agents, in the second, you will
 want to monitor their habits or give them incentives to behave

 When buying a car, the buyer does not know whether the quality of the car
 is good or bad.
 The seller/owner knows the quality of his car.
 Absent any way to prove the quality of his car, the seller of a good quality
 car will suffer a discount due to the presence of bad quality car sellers
 in the market.
 This might be an explanation for why cars lose so much value even right
 after being bought new.

 When selling car insurance, the insurer does not know whether the insured
 is careful or not in driving.
 The insured knows it, and those who drive badly will be more motivated
 to buy insurance than others.
 In the limit, the insurer should never sell insurance because only if it
 underestimated the risk of the insured would it sell.
 The same type of problem arises in borrowing and in health insurance, as
 well as in many used goods markets.

 In education, is a bad grade due to low effort by the student (moral hazard
 on the part of the student), to his/her intellectual limitations (type
 of the student) or to bad teaching (which can be either due to low effort
 on the part of the teacher or to his/her low ability)?

In the current credit crunch, is the poor performance of banks due to bad
 management of the banks, opportunistic behavior on the part of bankers,
 bad macroeconomic policies on the part of the governement, or poor regulatory
 oversight? The following Dilbert character seems to go for the later option:

It is often difficult in each of those example to agree on who has the most
 information (e.g.
 health).
 There are a variety of contracts that are signed between agents in those
 settings, which are meant to alleviate asymmetric information.
 For example, bonus/malus systems for car insurance are used in France:
 if you have an accident, your insurance price increases, which deters drivers
 from driving carelessly.
 US insurance companies impose medical checkups to screen their insurees.
 Companies offer return guarantees so as to prove their trust in the quality
 of their goods.

Agency and adverse selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this part, a typical model of adverse selection will be presented and
 the timing of the contractual relationship will be outlined.
 The first best outcome (which arises in contexts of perfect information)
 will be determined graphically and compared with the second best outcome
 (with asymmetric information).
 The role of incentive and participation constraints will be explained and
 the maximization program of the principal will be determined as well as
 its graphical solution.
 That solution will be compared with the first best.

The model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A principal gets utility 
\begin_inset Formula $S(q)$
\end_inset

 from obtaining quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 of a product that is produced by an agent at cost 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\theta,q)=\theta q$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the type of the agent, known to the agent and unknown to the principal,
 who expects 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\theta_{H}$
\end_inset

 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-v$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\theta_{L}$
\end_inset

 with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{H}>\theta_{L}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contracting variables 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $(q,t)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 being the (money) transfer from the principal to the agent and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 the quantity produced by the agent.
 Contract 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is enforceable under law, that is, a third party (a Court) can check a
 contract was signed and can check whether 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 that were determined in the contract were paid and/or produced or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under contract 
\begin_inset Formula $C,$
\end_inset

 the principal's utility is then 
\begin_inset Formula $S(q)-t$
\end_inset

.
 Agent of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 obtains utility is 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\theta q$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The timing of the contractual relationship is as follows: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1,$
\end_inset

 the agent learns its type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset

At 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2$

 the principal offers a (menu of) contract(s)

\begin_inset Formula $C_{1},C_{2},C_{3},$
\end_inset

 ...).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At 
\begin_inset Formula $t=3$
\end_inset

 the agent chooses a contract or chooses not to enter a contractual relationship
 
\begin_inset Formula $(C=C_{0}=(0,0)$
\end_inset

 is always an option, as no one can be forced into signing a contract)
\begin_inset Formula $.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At 
\begin_inset Formula $t=4$
\end_inset

 the contract is executed: the agent produces the quantity as agreed in
 the contract and the principal pays her the transfer as agreed in the contract.
 
\end_layout

The contracting timeline can thus be represented as follows:

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
In a `first best' world, the principal knows 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

; he can therefore ask any quantity from the agent provided the agent accepts.
 Knowing the type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 of the agent, the program of the principal is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & \underset{q,t}{\max}S(q)-t\\
\text{s.t. }t-\theta q & \geq0\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

 The principal thus maximizes the following Lagrangian:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\underset{q,t}{\max}(S(q)-t)+\lambda(t-\theta q)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which is maximixed for 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
S^{\prime}(q)-\lambda\theta & =0\\
-1+\lambda & =0\nonumber \\
t-\theta q & =0
\end{align}

\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\lambda & =1\\
S^{\prime}(q) & =\theta\nonumber \\
t & =\theta q
\end{align}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>0,$

 the rent left to either type is

 will be offered contract 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{H}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{H}-\theta_{H}q_{H}=0$

Interpretation of the graph:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
The arrows indicate the direction in which utility of the agent and of the
 principal, respectively, are maximized.
 Utility P for the principal is represented by the iso-utility convex function
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $S(q)-t=P$
\end_inset

, which determines all combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 such that utility P is achieved.
 Utility A for the agent is represented by iso-utility curve 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\theta q=A$
\end_inset

.
 In the equilibrium of the first best, A is equal to 0 for both types of
 agents.
 Utility for the principal is maximized at the point where the iso-utility
 convex function of the principal is tangent with the iso-utility function
 of the agent, i.e.
 the point such that 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\theta q=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S(q)-t$
\end_inset

 is maximized.

Incentive compatibility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
In the previous graph, one can observe that the utility of the good type
 is higher if she chooses the first best contract of the bad type rather
 than the contract that was destined for her.
 Therefore, the first best is not implementable if the type of the agent
 is not known to the principal.
 Under the second best, each type of agent must choose willingly the contract
 that is destined for him/her, so that the following incentive constraints
 (`IC') must be verified:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
t_{H}-\theta_{H}q_{H} & \geq t_{L}-\theta_{H}q_{L}\tag{IC\ensuremath{_{H}}}\label{IC}\\
t_{L}-\theta_{L}q_{L} & \geq t_{H}-\theta_{L}q_{H}\tag{IC\ensuremath{_{L}}}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Under those conditions, type 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 chooses contract 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{H}$

 chooses contract

The program of the principal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The program of the principal is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\underset{t_{L},q_{L},t_{H},q_{H}}{\max} & v(S(q_{L})-t_{L})+(1-v)(S(q_{H})-t_{H})\\
 & \text{s.t.}\nonumber \\
U_{H} & \geq U_{L}-\Delta q_{L}\\
U_{L} & \geq U_{H}+\Delta q_{H}\\
U_{H} & \geq0\\
U_{L} & \geq0
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
How can the program be solved? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size normal
First, note that adding up the participation constraint for both types,
 one obtains:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U_{H}+U_{L}\geq U_{L}+U_{H}+\Delta(q_{H}-q_{L})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which means that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{H}\leq q_{L}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The high type will produce less than the low type in the second best outcome.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size normal
Second, note that if the participation constraint on type 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is verified and the incentive constraint for type 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is verified, then the participation constraint for type 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is verified.
 The participation constraint for type 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is thus superfluous.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\size normal
Third, suppose now the incentive constraint for type 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is binding.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{L}=U_{H}+\Delta q_{H},$
\end_inset

 which, translated into the incentive constraint for type 
\begin_inset Formula $L,$
\end_inset

 means I must have 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{H}\geq U_{H}+\Delta(q_{H}-q_{L}),$
\end_inset

 which is always the case as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{H}\leq q_{L}.$
\end_inset

 Therefore, the incentive constraint for type 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is also superfluous.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
From this, I can conclude that the participation constraint for the high
 type will be binding (
\begin_inset Formula $U_{H}=0$
\end_inset

) while the incentive constraint for the low type will be binding (
\begin_inset Formula $U_{L}=\Delta q_{H}$
\end_inset

).
 This ensures all constraints are verified while minimizing the rent given
 out to each type.
 Taking the two above inequalities and replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{H}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}$
\end_inset

 by their expression in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{H},$
\end_inset

 the program of the principal can thus be simplified into:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\underset{q_{H},q_{L}}{\max}v(S(q_{L})-\theta_{L}q_{L})+(1-v)(S(q_{H})-\theta_{H}q_{H})-v\Delta q_{H}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
Maximizing the above with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{H}$
\end_inset

 one obtains
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S^{\prime}(q_{L})=\theta_{L}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S^{\prime}(q_{H})=\theta_{H}+\frac{v}{1-v}\Delta
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
Note how the result is distorted compared to the first best maximization
 program: There is no distortion for the good type who will produce the
 same as in the first best, while the bad type will produce less than in
 the first best.

Interpretation of the graph:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
No rent is left to the bad type, who produces less than the optimal level.
 The good type earns as much as what she would earn if she chose the contract
 for the bad type, and she produces the first best (optimal) level.
 The principal trades off between lowering the rent extracted by the good
 type and still producing close to the efficient level.
 By lowering the quantity asked from the bad type, the principal can decrease
 the rent that the good type must be given.
 This is how we go from the transfers and quantities that would be necessary
 to attain the first best, to the transfers and quantities the principal
 asks for at the second best optimum.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Consider an agent and a principal.
 The agent is asked to execute a task by the principal, and in that task
 the agent may exert effort

\end_inset

 either 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 (no effort) or 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 The cost of effort to the agent is 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(0)=0$
\end_inset

 for no effort and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(1)=\psi>0$
\end_inset

 for effort.
 The utility to the agent from getting transfer 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula

p_{1}t_{H}+(1-p_{1})t_{L}-\psi & =p_{0}t_{H}+(1-p_{0})t_{L}\\
p_{1}t_{H}+(1-p_{1})t_{L}-\psi & =0
\end{align}

\end_inset

 which has an unique solution:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
t_{L}^{\ast} & =-\frac{p_{0}\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}}\\
t_{H}^{\ast} & =\frac{(1-p_{0})\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}}
\end{align}

\end_inset

 So the expected payment for the principal is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{1}t_{H}^{\ast}+(1-p_{1})t_{L}^{\ast}=\psi
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
This is the same as would be paid if effort was observable, i.e.
 the principal merely compensates the agent for her effort.
 One would also see that the same expected payment (
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

) as in observable effort would be made in case no effort was needed.
 This means that even with asymmetric information on effort, the first best
 level of effort is implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
Note however this holds only when the agent is risk neutral and has infinite
 wealth.
 Let us now see what happens if there is a liability constraint or if the
 agent is risk averse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Liability constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
Suppose the limited liability constraint is 
\begin_inset Formula $L,$
\end_inset

 so the agent cannot lose more than 
\begin_inset Formula $L.$
\end_inset

 One will then have to impose limited liability constraints such that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{H}>-L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}>-L$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as the initial wealth of the agent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
If 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{p_{0}\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}}>-L$
\end_inset

, then the problem is unchanged (the first best outcome can be implemented).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
If 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{p_{0}\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}}<-L$
\end_inset

, then the outcome without liability constraint cannot be achieved, and
 one obtains that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
t_{L}^{\ast} & =-L\\
t_{H}^{\ast} & =-L+\frac{\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
As in the previous program, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{H}^{\ast}=t_{L}^{\ast}+\frac{\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}},$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 is now raised to 
\begin_inset Formula $-L.$
\end_inset

 The agent will get a limited liability rent, as her expected utility is
 now
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
EU & =p_{1}t_{H}^{\ast}+(1-p_{1})t_{L}^{\ast}-\psi\\
 & =p_{1}\frac{\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}}-L-\psi\\
 & =(p_{1}-p_{0})\frac{\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}}-L-\psi+p_{0}\frac{\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}}\\
 & =-L+p_{0}\frac{\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}}>0
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
The principal's utility is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
V & =p_{1}(S(q_{H})-t_{H}^{\ast})+(1-p_{1})(S(q_{L})-t_{L}^{\ast})\\
 & =p_{1}(S(q_{H})-\frac{\psi}{p_{1}-p_{0}})+(1-p_{1})S(q_{L})-L
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size normal
which is less than the first best.
 Because of limited liability constraints in moral hazards problems, the
 principal may not want to induce effort even when this would be optimal
 in the first best with perfect observation of effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Risk aversion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assumed up to now that 
\begin_inset Formula $u(t)=t$
\end_inset

, that is, the agent was risk neutral.
 If the agent is risk averse, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u(t)$
\end_inset

 is strictly concave.
 Then the principal will want to limit the difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{H}$
\end_inset

 because this then makes the contract less risky, and thus more acceptable
 to the agent.
 Risk aversion thus induces a distortion from the first best, that is, there
 are situations where the principal will not want to induce effort (it is
 too costly to do so) even though this would be optimal under full information,
 and would occur under risk neutrality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Extensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part examines some hidden assumptions made in the previous parts.
 In particular, we assumed that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Agents are able to commit to fulfilling the terms of the contract they sign.
 What happens then if agents cannot commit not to renegotiate a contract
 once the type of the agent (adverse selection) or the outcome of his effort
 (moral hazard) is known?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A court of law could be called on to enforce the terms of the signed contracts.
 What happens then if the principal may renege on the contract?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will therefore look at those issues and see how standard theory applies
 in those alternative settings when the principal cannot commit.
 We will also examine other possible extensions, such as what happens if
 the principal is better informed than the agent, rather than the opposite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Repeated adverse selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following model with repeated adverse selection illustrates what happens
 if the principal cannot commit not to renegotiate after a contract is accepted
 or after an action is taken by the agent (chapter 9, section 3, Laffont
 and Martimort, 2002).
 Consider thus the standard adverse selection model, and assume it is repeated
 twice with the same agent and the same principal both period.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V=S(q_{1})-t_{1}+\delta(S(q_{2})-t_{2})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 is the total utility of the principal over the two periods (the second
 period payoffs are discounted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U=t_{1}-\theta q_{1}+\delta(t_{2}-\theta q_{2})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 is the total utility of the agent over the two periods, with the second
 period payoff discounted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume the principal can commit not to renegotiate.
 Then the optimal contract is to repeat the optimal one-period contract
 in the two period.
 However, this then calls for the bad type to produce 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{H}^{SB}<q_{H}^{\ast}.$
\end_inset

 The principal would then gain from renegotiating after the first period,
 once agents revealed their type through their choice of contract, so as
 to get the bad type, 
\begin_inset Formula $H,$
\end_inset

 to produce the first best level 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{H}^{\ast}$
\end_inset

.
 However, if the principal did this, the good type would then have to be
 compensated for not taking the contract of the bad type.
 Therefore, if the principal cannot commit not to renogotiate type 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 's contract, then she must leave a higher surplus to the good type than
 if it could commit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denote 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\tau t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\tau t}$
\end_inset

 the quantity and transfers asked from and paid to type 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=H,L$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1,2$
\end_inset

.
 For good type (L) not to choose the contract designed for the bad type
 if the bad type's contract is due to be renegotiated in the second period
 so the bad type would produce 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{H}^{*}$
\end_inset

, one must have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{L1}-\theta_{L}q_{L}^{\ast}+\delta(t_{L2}-\theta_{L}q_{L}^{\ast})\geq t_{H}-\theta_{L}q_{H1}+\delta(t_{H}-\theta_{L}q_{H}^{\ast})
\]

 the equation the utility of the good type if she chose the contract designed
 for the bad type, and as usual, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=\theta_{H}-\theta$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $_{L}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is to be compared with the constraint with full commitment (if the
 principal can commit not to renegotiate) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{L}\geq U_{H}+\Delta(q_{H1}+\delta q_{H2})
\]

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{H}^{\ast}>q_{H2}$
\end_inset

 the first constraint is more stringent than the second, which means the
 principal loses from his inability to not to renegotiate.
 There may be a loss of efficiency from that situation if 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is high.
 Indeed, the principal may then prefer not to know the types of the agents
 in the first period (and thus offer a pooling contract in the first period,
 whereby both types choose the same contract), so as not to learn the type
 of the agent in the first period, and thus not have any basis for a renegotiati
on in the second period, when the optimal one period contract will be offered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The hold up problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, we explore what happens in the more serious problem where
 the principal cannot commit not to renege on a contract.
 This may be for example because there is no court of law that can force
 him not to do so.
 In a moral hazard setting, this leads to a hold up problem (chapter 9,
 section 4, Laffont and Martimort, 2002).
 Take indeed the standard moral hazard problem.
 The principal would like to commit to pay more when the result is good.
 However, after the effort is made and a high result is achieved, the principal'
s self interest is to renege on the contract and not compensate the agent
 for his effort.
 This problem can happen in a wide variety of settings even when an efficient
 court of law is present.
 For example, this can happen if no formal contract was signed beforehand
 or if the result to be achieved was ill-defined.
 This hold-up problem is particularly prevalent for the State, especially
 if the judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 The cost of forcing the State's to abide by its commitments can indeed
 be prohibitive.
 It is for example too easy for the State to change its taxation policy
 to overturn previous pro-business commitments, or to withdraw financial
 incentives to firms that adopted socially or environmentally-responsible
 practices once firms have changed their way of doing business.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In those cases, the result of the principal's inability to commit not to
 renege on a contract is even worse for the principal than in the case where
 there was inability to commit not to renegotiate: no contract can be signed
 with the agent and agents exert only the lowest effort level.
 The problem may be mitigated if rather than signing contract, the agent
 and the principal bargain after the state of nature is revealed.
 It may also be mitigated if the agent knows what is the state of nature
 before signing the contract and exerting effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other extensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Informed principal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Situations with an informed principal are those in which it is the type
 of the principal that matters, and this type is not known to either the
 principal or the agent before contracting (we will see later about the
 case where the principal knows the type).
 The situation can be modeled as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $V=S(q,\theta)-t$
\end_inset

, is the principal's payoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $U=u(t-\theta q)$
\end_inset

, is the payoff of the agent.
 As can be seen, it depends on the type of the principal.

\begin_layout Standard
Note that to the difference of the standard incentive problem, the principal
 must now have an incentive to reveal his own type truthfully.
 Once the principal reveals his own type, the agent produces 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and receive 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as agreed in the contract for when the principal is of that specific type.
 The situation is reversed compared to the standard, informed agent setting:
 if the principal is of a bad type, then the first best level of production
 will be asked, while if the principal is of a good type, then there will
 be more production than first best optimal (chapter 9, subsection 1, Laffont
 and Martimort, 2002).
 Note however that if the agent is risk neutral, then the first best levels
 of production can be achieved, while in the standard case, even if the
 agent was risk neutral, there was still a distortion.
\end_layout

In the above, we focused on a case where, at the time of offering the contract,
 the principal did not know his own type.

 examines the more complicated case where the principal knows his own type
 before offering the contract.
 This type of situation can happen for example in franchise contracts.
 A potential MacDonald franchisee may know less about her business than
 the franchiser (MacDonald), who indeed would know more about local market
 conditions or the current success of its offering.
 This type of situation may also apply to a job applicant when negotiating
 an employment contract with a firm.
 The agent will then wants to learn the type of the firm (close to bankruptcy
 or not, for example) from the type of contract the firm offers.
 Complex issues of signaling, as in the 
\begin_inset Quotes els

lemons problem
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

 for example, arise, as the principal

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mixed models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seldom does one have pure adverse selection or pure moral hazard.
 In most situations, there is either adverse selection followed by moral
 hazard or moral hazard followed by adverse selection (chapter 7, Laffont
 and Martimort, 2002).
 Insurance is a typical example: the effort by the agent in avoiding accidents
 may depends on its type, her tendency for recklessness for example.
 In this case, adverse selection (type) precedes moral hazard (effort).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The adverse selection problem will be exarcebated by moral hazard (compounding
 factor), as the bad, reckless type will do less effort to avoid accidents,
 thus increasing the discrepancy in terms of probability of a bad outcome
 between good and bad type.
 In the opposite case, where moral hazard is 
\emph on
followed by
\emph default
 adverse selection (for example, when effort to get an education also changes
 one's type in a way that is favorable), then the moral hazard problem may
 be weakened by adverse selection, as agents may exert more effort in order
 to acquire a good type, and not only just to increase the probability of
 a good outcome.

It was assumed that the agent knew its own type (adverse selection), or

 What happens now if the participants can choose what information they have

 It then becomes necessary to motivate information acquisition by the agent

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The revelation principle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In adverse selection problems we assumed up to now that the principal would
 offer one contract (or less) for each different type of agent.
 For example, with two types, the principal would offer either:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Two different contract that would be such that each type would choose a
 different one (the contracts are 
\begin_inset Quotes els
\end_inset

separating
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

 both types), or it would offer only 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One contract that both types would choose (the contract is 
\begin_inset Quotes els
\end_inset

pooling
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

 both types).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One contract such that only one type would accept a contract (the contract
 is excluding one type).
 The other type chose the 
\begin_inset Quotes els
\end_inset

no contract
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

 option 
\begin_inset Formula $C=(0,0)$
\end_inset

 that gave it its reservation utility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of separating contracts, as each type chose a different contract,
 the principal gained information on the agents
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

 types from their choice of contract.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section re-examines the very simple setting introduced in the lecture
 on adverse selection to examine whether it could ever be beneficial for
 the principal to offer a third or more contracts, offer more options than
 simply quantity and transfer 
\begin_inset Formula $(q,t)$
\end_inset

 contracts or asking the agent for more information than simply their choice
 of contract.

This part will prove that the above type of solution, in terms of 
\emph on
truthful DRM
\emph default
 is general, that is, it is never beneficial to offer more contracts than
 there are types (principle of economy), there is no point in asking the
 agent for more than to just announce a type (or for more than just choosing
 a contract), and there is no loss in generality in looking only at DRM
 where agents announce their type truthfully.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, if the only communication between the agent and the principal
 is to tell one's type (or another type), then there can be only so many
 contracts as there are types.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Unless, to the announcement of a type, the principal offers a contract chosen
 at random between a number of contracts.
 But then, among those contracts, there must be one that gives higher utility
 to the principal than another, given the announced type, so the principal
 would be better off not choosing randomly.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In order to test the principle of economy, let
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

s thus consider a set of messages 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 that can be transmitted by the agent to the principal.
 Those messages can be the choice of contract, the type of the agent, or
 any other information.
 The mechanism is then of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $C:\: M\rightarrow A$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 the set of allocations 
\begin_inset Formula $(q,\: t)$
\end_inset

.
 This means that to any message 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 associates an allocation (contract) 
\emph on
s.t.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $C(m)=(q(m),\: t(m))$
\end_inset

.
 Agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 will then rationally choose to communicate the message 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{*}(\theta$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m^{\ast}(\theta)=\underset{m^{\prime}}{\arg\max}\{t(m^{\prime})-\theta q(m^{\prime})\}.\label{eq:message}

The

 each agent can limit her communication to announcing her type (rather than
 some more general message 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

and since

\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $C'$

\begin_layout Standard
Intuitively, suppose the contracts offering were such that an agent of type
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is better off announcing she is of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta'\neq\theta$
\end_inset

 (all other agents announce truthfully).
 Then this contract offering is equivalent to another contract offering
 that gets rid of the contract that is assigned to an agent that announces
 she is of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Under that new contract offering, agents 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta'$
\end_inset

 are pooled into the same contract.
 This new contract offering is equivalent to a contract offering such that
 whether you announce your type is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta'$
\end_inset

, you are assigned the same contract.
 And in this case, agent of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 may as well announce she is of type 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, by extension, any contract offering that is not a truthful DRM
 has an equivalent that is a truthful DRM.

The following introduces an example (auctions) where the revelation principle
 can be used to great effect to simplify and solve apparently intractable
 problems.
 We also consider limitations to the truthful DRM in voting problems, where
 there are many agents and agents know not only their own type, but also
 know others' types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Application: Auctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We saw in the game theory part of this course that offering agents to play
 second price auctions resulted in a DRM where each agent announced her
 type (i.e.
 her valuation for the good).
 If she won (her valuation was the highest), she paid the second highest
 announced valuation.
 First price auction however did not result in a DRM: agents, rather than
 announcing their own valuation, would announce half their own valuation
 (indeed, each agent would optimally bid half her valuation for the good).
 However, first price auctions are implementable through the following DRM:
 agents announce their own type (valuation for the good), and pay half of
 that valuation if they win.
 More generally, the revelation principle is useful in the context of auctions
 as it shows there is no point in studying such and such specific mechanism
 (first price, second price, loser pays, etc.), as one can limit oneself
 to simple, direct revelation mechanism, knowing that they are the equivalent
 of the more complicated designs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Voting mechanisms and limits to truthful DRMs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we said up to now was that a principal who wished to make a decision
 when faced with informed agents could limit himself to considering only
 mechanisms (ways to reach a decision) that are truthful DRMs.
 However, this does not mean that such mechanisms will have any desirable
 properties, or even that they will exist.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to illustrate this point, consider the following collective decision
 problem.
 There are three agents, 
\emph on

 The principal should choose the option that minimizes the sum of the rank

This means that there is no hope for a rule that would lead the principal
 to choose the best option for all possible rankings of the options by all
 agents.
 This is because any rule could be subject to manipulation under some circumstan

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this is true if agents know each other's type (ranking), there are
 truthful DRM in Bayesian strategies if agents know their own type (ranking),
 but do not know the type (ranking) of the other agents (Chapter 
\emph on
23.D
\emph default
 of the Mas-Colell).
 In that case there are mechanisms such that the agents announce their type
 truthfully given their 
\emph on

 (the average) of what the other agents
\begin_inset Quotes ers

 types will be.
 Note that to the different of truthful DRM that we looked at up to now,
 where the agent would play the same whathever his belief about other agents'
 types (truthful DRMs in dominant strategies), truthful DRM in Bayesian
 strategies lead the agent to play differently depending on his belief about
 other agents' type.
 Truthful DRM in Bayesian strategies are thus less robust than truthful
 DRMs in dominant strategies, as their outcome will depend on agents' beliefs,
 which may be arbitrary and out of step with reality.
