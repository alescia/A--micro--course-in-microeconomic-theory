  abstract = {Tournaments, reward structures based on rank order, are compared with
	individual contracts in a model with one risk-neutral principal and
	many risk-averse agents. Each agent's output is a stochastic function
	of his effort level plus an additive shock term that is common to
	all the agents. The principal observes only the output levels of
	the agents. It is shown that, in the absence of a common shock, using
	optimal independent contracts dominates using the optimal tournament.
	Conversely, if the distribution of the common shock is sufficiently
	diffuse, using the optimal tournament dominates using optimal independent
	contracts. Finally, it is shown that for a sufficiently large number
	of agents, a principal who cannot observe the common shock but uses
	the optimal tournament does as well as one who can observe the shock
	and uses independent contracts.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from
	another version of this item.)},
