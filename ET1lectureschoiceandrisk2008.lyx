 The consequences of EUT in terms of prescribed or predicted behavior will
 be analyzed, and this will be compared with empirical and experimental
 data on the behavior of agents.
 That data will be shown not to conform with EUT in some cases, which means
 EUT may not be an adequate descriptive model of behavior.
 Alternative models that take better account of the reality of the patterns
 of decision making of economic agents will thus be presented and discussed.

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Uncertainty
\emph default
 may be due to the incomplete information about the action of others, the
 inability to predict complex events (weather), limitations in one's capacity

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Outcomes
\emph default
 are defined in terms of utility.
 Outcomes will be influenced by your choice of action and the realization
 of random events on which you have no influence.
 For example, a chicken that decides to cross a road will either die if
 a car happens to come by, or live if no car happens to come by.
 We assign `utility' to those two possible outcomes.
 At its most basic, utility is defined in terms of preferences, for example,
 do you prefer sun or rain?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The agent is supposed to know what acts she can choose, i.e.
 she knows her options.
 She is also supposed to know the set of all possible `state of nature'
 that may prevail, as well as be able to evaluate the probability, objective
 or subjective, of the occurrence of each possible state of nature.
 She is also supposed to be able to evaluate the utility of all possible
 consequences of each of her actions (outcomes).
 Consequence functions are defined as what happens if you chose an act and
 such or such state of nature occurred.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Consider for example a chicken faced with the decision whether to cross
 the road.
 The consequence function of crossing the road combined with the event that
 a car is on the road is what happens in that case, i.e.
 the chicken is run over and dies.
 This can be denoted as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c(\underset{\text{event}}{\underbrace{\text{car on the road}},}\underset{\text{action}}{\underbrace{\text{cross the road}}})=\underset{\text{outcome}}{\underbrace{\text{death}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under this setting, you are supposed to know the utility of the outcome
 of your whole set of action under any possible circumstances, e.g.
 the chicken is supposed to be able to anticipate any possible event that
 may occur when he crosses the road, and the outcome of his action under
 any of those events.
 You know this in advance even though you may never have experienced such
 combination of circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, your choice would be greatly simplified if a function allowed
 you to calculate the expected utility of an action based on the expected
 probability of the outcomes that will result from that action and an evaluation
 of the utility of each of those outcomes, so as to obtain automatically
 your expected utility from an action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why would you want to predict the utility of an action? This is because
 you are constantly having to make decisions under uncertainty, and want
 to take the decision that will maximize utility.
 We will see in the following that subject to some assumptions on how you
 make basic decisions and rank the utility of events, then one obtain a
 very simple way to evaluate the utility of any outcome.
 Let us first present what is a lottery and how they can be represented
 graphically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Lotteries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lotteries are diagrammatic representations of the choice you are facing.
 Simple lotteries assign probabilities to outcomes, which can be numerical,
 monetary or other (e.g.
 a trip to the moon or a teddy bear).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider one agent 
\begin_inset Formula $A,$
\end_inset

 for example, agent 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is `chicken'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $(1,...,s,...,S)$
\end_inset

 is the set of states of nature, for example (car on the road, no car on
 the road)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $(1,...,x,...,X)$
\end_inset

 is the set of actions that are available to you, for example (cross the
 street, don't cross the street)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $c(s,x)$
\end_inset

 is a consequence function or outcomes, which is dependend both on the state
 of nature 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and your action 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $c($
\end_inset

 car on the road, cross the street
\begin_inset Formula $)$
\end_inset

 is `death', as explained above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $p(s)$
\end_inset

 is a probability function, that gives out the probability of each state
 of nature.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $p($
\end_inset

 car on the road
\begin_inset Formula $)=0.7$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Most of the time, one will take action 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as given and denote 
\begin_inset Formula $c(s,x)$
\end_inset

 in short hand as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(s)$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{s}.$
\end_inset

 Then, the lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 that results from action 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is defined by the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $C=(c_{1},...,c_{s},...,c_{S})$
\end_inset

 of possible consequences of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and its vector 
\begin_inset Formula $P=(p_{1},...,p_{s},...,p_{S})$
\end_inset

 of the probabilities of each consequences in 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Most of the time, one will take the set of consequences as a given, so that
 lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 will be denoted by its vector 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 of probabilities associated to each consequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Take the set of consequences 
\begin_inset Formula $C=($
\end_inset

 death, life on this side of the road, life on the other side of the road
 
\begin_inset Formula $)$
\end_inset

.
 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 the lottery which results from the action `cross the street' and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 the lottery which results from the action `don't cross the street'.
 In short-hand, one can denote 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(0.7,0,0.3)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1,0).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If the chicken prefers lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2},$
\end_inset

 one will denote this as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}\succ L_{2}$
\end_inset

 and this guarantees the chicken crosses the road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the chicken is indifferent between lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 and lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2},$
\end_inset

 one will denote this as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}\sim L_{2},$
\end_inset

 and the chicken may or may not cross the road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the chicken considers the lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 to be at least as good as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2},$
\end_inset

 one will denote this as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}\succeq L_{2}$
\end_inset

 and say that the chicken has a weak preference for 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 In that case, one does not know whether the chicken is indifferent between
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 or if it actually prefers 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 One knows however that the chicken does not prefer 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 From an observational point of view, if the chicken crosses the road, one
 knows that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}\succeq L_{2}$
\end_inset

 but nothing more.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If the chicken crosses the road, then that means that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}\succeq L_{2}$
\end_inset

 .
 However, saying that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}\succeq L_{2}$
\end_inset

 does not give any explanation for the behavior of the chicken, but merely
 translates an observation of its behavior.
 I do not know why the chicken crossed the road, I merely know it did.

 A particular lottery,

\begin_inset Formula $L_{3}\succ L_{1}$
\end_inset

 (which is intransitive), then it must cross one or the other or both of
 the two previous indifference curves inside the triangle (Figure below).
 Conversely, if indifference curves cross inside the triangle, then there
 may be situations where transitivity does not hold.

Uniqueness of

 guarantees the indifference curves are continuous.
 This is because this axiom guarantees that any point in the triangle (any
 lottery) has an equivalent along the hypotenuse, and that this equivalent
 is unique.
 Suppose indeed that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{3}$
\end_inset

 is the top corner of the triangle and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 the right corner of the M-M triangle, and consider

 any point in the triangle.
 The axiom says that for some

\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 .
 But 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha L_{3}+(1-\alpha)L_{1}$
\end_inset

 is a point on the hypotenuse of the triangle.
 Therefore, any lottery has an equivalent along the hypotenuse, and conversely.
 This means that there are no spaces either on the hypotenuse or in the
 triangle that would have no equivalent (there are no `jump' in the indifference
 curves).

Exercise:
\emph default
 The following exercise adresses a common misconception over what 
\emph on
independence
\emph default
 means.
 Suppose you are in Sydney and you are offered lotteries over the outcome
 space 
\begin_inset Formula $C=$
\end_inset

(train ticket to Paris, train ticket to London).
 Do you prefer 
\begin_inset Formula $p=(1,0)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q=(0,1),$
\end_inset

 i.e.
 a ticket to Paris or a ticket to London? Suppose now the outcome space
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $C=$
\end_inset

(ticket to Paris, ticket to London, movie about Paris).
 Do you prefer 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\prime}=(0.8,0,0.2)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\prime}=(0,0.8,0.2)$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Answer:
\emph on
 
\emph default
Many students who say they prefer 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 will also say they prefer 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

.
 It may be that this type of choice is the result of improper understanding
 of what is a lottery rather than something more basic, so agents do not
 want 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is no point watching a movie about Paris if I go there anyway
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, students may not understand that each lottery will result in only
 one of the outcomes being realized, not two combined outcomes together.
 An alternative explanation may be that students do not want to face, under
 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

, the prospect of watching a movie about Paris which would make them regret
 even more not having won the ticket to Paris.
 In any case, this type of reversal of preferences is a violation of the
 independence axiom, as adding a common consequence to the original lotteries
 should not change preferences among lotteries.

A Representation Theorem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
[Representation theorem] If the four axioms presented above hold, then there
 exists a utility index 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 such that ranking according to expected utility accords with actual preference
 over lotteries.
 In other words, if we compare two lotteries, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 represented by the probability vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $P=(p_{s})_{s=1,...,S}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=(q_{s})_{s=1,...,S}$
\end_inset

 over the same set of outcomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}=(1,...,S)$
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{1}\preceq L_{2}\Leftrightarrow\underset{s=1}{\overset{s=S}{\sum}}p_{s}u(c_{s})\leq\underset{s=1}{\overset{s=S}{\sum}}q_{s}u(c_{s})

\begin_layout Description
Proof: See pp.176-178 of the Mas-Colell or p.
 76 of Kreps.
 The easiest proof assumes there exist a worst, 
\begin_inset Formula $w,$
\end_inset

 and a best lottery, 
\begin_inset Formula $t,$
\end_inset

 and defines the utility of any lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 as the number such that 
\begin_inset Formula $p\sim u(p)t+(1-u(p))w.$
\end_inset

 By continuity, that number exists and is unique.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 itself is defined over the set of consequence 
\begin_inset Formula $C:(a,b,c)$
\end_inset

, and each of those consequences can be ascribed an utility according to
 the above method.
 Define thus 
\begin_inset Formula $u(a)$
\end_inset

 the utility of consequence 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 for example.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula $p\sim p(a)a+p(b)b+p(c)c$
\end_inset

 (by reducibility).
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula $a\sim u(a)t+(1-u(a))w$
\end_inset

, and similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 By the independence axiom, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\sim(p(a)u(a)+p(b)u(b)+p(c)u(c))t+(1-p(a)u(a)-p(b)u(b)-p(c)u(c))w.$
\end_inset

 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $u(p)=p(a)u(a)+p(b)u(b)+p(c)u(c).$

\begin_layout Itemize
The utility function is an ordinal measure of utility, not a cardinal measure.
 This means the specific value 
\begin_inset Formula $u(c_{s})$
\end_inset

 is not what is important, rather it is the ranking of lotteries which must
 be translated in a correct way by the utility function.
 This means you do NOT have to translate outcomes into one common measure,
 such as for example money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Said in another way, the theorem is a 
\emph on

 -- in other words it means we can represent preferences using the utility
 function, but that doesn't mean that individuals gain `utility' from outcomes.

\begin_layout Itemize
To make the point further, 
\begin_inset Formula $u(.)$

\begin_inset Formula $U(.)=a+bu(.)$

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $b>0$

, one has to remember the following points:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Axioms of EUT are intuitively `reasonable' assumptions about preferences.
 Whether they fit real choice (positive axioms) or are good guides for action
 (normative axioms) is up to one's perspective.
 The axioms, while reasonable, are not necessarily prescriptive or necessarily
 backed up or drawn from experimental evidence.
 One will see indeed that agent's actions do not necessarily fit with EUT,
 which means one or more of the axioms are not respected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Together, the axioms imply EUT while EU representations imply the axioms
 are verified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You need to know, understand and be able to use the axioms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Application to lottery comparisons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EUT provides a simple ways to compare lotteries.
 Indeed, consider the EU of lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}:$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
EU(L)=p_{1}U(x_{1})+p_{2}U(x_{2})+p_{3}U(x_{3})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rewrite this as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
EU(L)=p_{1}U(x_{1})+(1-p_{1}-p_{3})U(x_{2})+p_{3}U(x_{3})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we differentiate that equation with respect to probability, then we obtain
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dEU(L)=-dp_{1}(U(x_{2})-U(x_{1}))+dp_{3}(U(x_{3})-U(x_{2})=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 for any two points on the same indifference curve.
 Rearranging, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{U(x_{2})-U(x_{1})}{U(x_{3})-U(x_{2})}=\frac{dp_{3}}{dp_{1}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which is a constant (check indeed that the ratio is independent of the
 specific normalization chosen for the utility functional).
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dp_{3}}{dp_{1}},$
\end_inset

 which is the slope of indifference lines in the M-M triangle, is always
 the same, no matter where we are in the Marschak-Machina triangle.
 This means that once we have found two points in the M-M triangle which
 give the same utility to a particular person, then we can predict how that
 person will choose between any two point in the M-M triangle.
 It is this remarkable feature of expected utility theory which makes it
 so straightforward to test: you need only find two (non-degenerate) indifferent
 lotteries to know the preferences over the whole set of lotteries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Checking that EUT holds means one will have to check that indifference curves
 are indeed straight parallel lines, by asking agents for their preferences
 over lotteries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the agent prefers not betting and keeping her $10,000, she gets utility
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(10000)=9.2103404$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If she bets, then she loses $100 with probability 1/2 and gains $101 with
 probability 1/2, so her expected utility is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2\ln(10000-100)+1/2\ln(10000+101)=9.2103399$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(10000),$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsection
Process violation

\begin_layout Standard
A common example of violation of transitivity is the 
\begin_inset Quotes grd
\end_inset

P-bet, $-bet
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the following two lotteries:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
P-bet: $30 with 90% probability, and zero otherwise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
$-bet: $100 with 30% probability and zero otherwise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An agent is first asked which lottery they would prefer playing, and then
 asked what price they would buy a ticket to play the P-bet or the $-bet.
 Notice that in this example, the expected payoff of the $-bet is higher
 than that of P-bet, but the $-bet is also more risky (lower probability
 to win).
 This may be why people tend to choose to play the P-bet over the $-bet.
 Yet, the same people are ready to pay 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 for a ticket to play the $-bet than for a ticket to play a P-bet.
 Said in another way, although when directly asked, they would choose the
 P-bet, they are willing to pay a lower certainty-equivalent amount of money
 for a P-bet than they do for a $-bet.
 For example, they might express a preference for the P-bet, but be ready
 only to pay $25 to play the P-bet while being ready to pay $27 for the
 $-bet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many have claimed that this violates the transitivity axiom.
 The argument is that one must be indifferent between the certainty-equivalent
 amount (
\begin_inset Quotes grd
\end_inset

price
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of the bet and playing it, so that in utility terms, taking the example
 above again, I would have 
\begin_inset Formula $U(P-bet)=U(\$25)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U(\$-bet)=U(\$27)$
\end_inset

.
 By monotonicity, since more money is better than less money, 
\begin_inset Formula $U(\$27)>U(\$25)$
\end_inset

 and so we should conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula $U(\$-bet)>U(P-bet)$
\end_inset

.
 Yet, when asked directly, people usually prefer the 
\begin_inset Formula $P-bet$
\end_inset

 to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\$-bet$
\end_inset

, implying 
\begin_inset Formula $U(P-bet)>U(\$-bet).$
\end_inset

 Thus, the intransitivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the question is whether this 
\begin_inset Quotes grd
\end_inset

intransitivity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is not simply due to overpricing of $-bets, i.e.
 agents being unable to price bets correctly.
 For example, I once offered to a student a ticket for a bet giving 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 chance of $100 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 chance of $0.
 I was offered $12 in exchange for that ticket.
 When I asked the same person how much they would sell me a ticket for this
 bet, they quoted a price of $43...
 Was the discrepancy due to improper understanding by the student, to lack
 of experience, to an exaggerated fear of getting it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in front of others, or to the fact this was not real money? Would the discrepan
cy have survived if the student had been given the opportunity to change
 his bids, or if a negotiation process had been put in place? One could
 design a series of alternative design for the experiment, but it illustrates
 a Willingness to Accept / Willingness to Pay disparity that survives whatever

\begin_layout Standard
The subject is asked to choose between the two, and then is asked how much
 they are prepared to pay for each of them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the subject chose the P-bet and quoted a higher price (e.g.
 $3.5) for it than for the $-bet (e.g.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the subject chose the P-bet but then quoted a lower price (e.g.
 $3.5) for it than for the $-bet (e.g.
 $4.5), then this was judged to potentially indicate a reversal of preference.
 In order to determine if that potential reversal was merely due to overpricing
 of the $-bet, experimenters then asked the subject to choose between each
 bet and a stated amount, $4 in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If the subject chooses $4 rather than the $-bet, then that means they previously
 overpriced the $-bet and there was thus a framing effect at play rather
 than a true violation of transitivity.
 Indeed, the only reason there was an apparent violation of transitivity
 is merely that in one case the subject was asked to make a choice between
 lotteries, and in the second case, he was asked to price lotteries.
 Those are rather different mental processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If on the other hand the subject indeed choose the $-bet over the $4 and
 the $4 over the P-bet, then that meant there was true violation of transitivity
, independent of any framing effect.
 Indeed, the question was framed the same way (choice between lotteries)
 and led to a contradiction of transitivity.

 contend that violations of transitivity may occur because agents use rather
 less sophisticated techniques than EUT to evaluate lotteries.
 They posit that agents tend to choose lotteries with the larger probability
 as long as the payoffs are close, and choose lotteries with the larger
 payoff is the payoffs are far away.
 This can lead to intransivities.
 For example, suppose an agent is asked to choose between 60% probability
 of getting $8 
\begin_inset Formula $(L_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 30% probability of getting $18 
\begin_inset Formula $(L_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Payoffs are close, so most agents choose the first as it has higher probabiliti
es to win.
 Suppose then the agent is offered $4 for sure against 60% probability of
 getting $8.
 Again, payoffs are close, so most people agents choose the first.
 Finally, however, most agents would choose 30% probability of getting $18
 rather than $4 with certainty, as payoffs are far apart so the lottery
 with the higher payoff is preferred.
 This leads to a violation of transitivity.
 Indeed, the first choice implies 
\begin_inset Formula $u(L_{1})>u(L_{2}).$
\end_inset

 The second choice implies 
\begin_inset Formula $u(L_{1})<u(\$4).$
\end_inset

 The third choice implies 
\begin_inset Formula $u(L_{2})>u(\$4).$
\end_inset

 Combining the two last choices, 
\begin_inset Formula $u(L_{2})>u(L_{1}),$
\end_inset

 which contradicts the original choice between lotteries.
 As above, the advantage of this design is that the agent is always asked
 for their choice among lotteries and are never asked to evaluate them individua
lly.
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_layout Standard
This can be generalized to say that agents will try to minimize the number
 of informations on which to draw their decisions rather than taking into
 account all the parameters in the decision.
 E.g.
 when choosing between two brands of foods, you will not look all the ingredient
s that came into their making but rather will choose salient dimensions
 such as sugar content and price to make your decision.

 This

 is not explained by wealth effects, but may be due to loss aversion (which
 will come up in 
\begin_inset Quotes els
\end_inset

regret theory
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

).
 For example, if losses are more painful than equally sized gains are pleasurabl
e, then one will offer to pay only $12 to play a lottery with 50% chance
 of getting $100 so as to minimize loss in case of bad luck (when the lottery
 draws $0, so the loss is $12), while one will be prepared to sell the bet
 only at the much higher $43 to minimize loss in case of bad luck, in this
 case, when the lottery draws $100 (the loss is $57).

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those experiments that contradict the predictions of EUT are interesting
 because they do not require to estimate utility functions for individuals,
 and they allow for a direct test of the axioms.
 The drawback is that they do not allow one to know how `badly' inconsistent
 the choices of the agents are.
 This would require many more experiments.
 The only information from those experiments is the percentage of individuals
 whose choices violate EUT, and in what specific way the choice is violated.
 An obvious critique of the above experiments is that the choices asked
 from subjects in those experiments are rather too complicated and unintuitive
 compared with the type of choices they are facing in real life.
 The issue is then to present the problem in an intuitive form, or to allow
 the subjects to get acquainted with the way the experiment is set up and
 the way its consequences will affect them (i.e.
 let them play many rounds).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note however that some of the experiments exposed above were adapted to
 rats using food as a currency and those experiments showed violations of
 the independence axiom as well.
 This points to a possible evolutionary benefit of behaving in ways that
 are different from those of an expected utility maximizer.
 Some experiments have been done comparing how farmers in traditional farming
 communities evaluate lotteries, and have indeed shown their behavior, while
 different from urbanized people, may have evolutionary benefits in a context
 where droughts and famines are likely (Humphrey and Verschoor (2004).

 Those utility representations differ from EUT by considering subjective
 probabilities as a function of objective probabilities, that correspond
 to how people estimate probabilities in reality (probability weighting
 functions).
 They also differ by considering an

editing phase
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, whereby one divides the set of consequences of a lottery into either `gains'
 or `losses'.
 Different probability weighting functions are assigned to probabilities

The reason for offering that type of representation is that there tends
 to be a difference between `psychological probability' and `objective probabili
ty': agents are quite able to estimate lotteries with probability between
 around 
\begin_inset Formula $1/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2/3$
\end_inset

 but overestimate low occurrence events and underestimate high occurrence
 events.
 Below 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 in the graph above, the agent weighs events above their statistical probability
, while this is the opposite for events with statistical probability above
 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\ast}$
\end_inset

.
 Intuitively, agents overweigh the probability of events with low statistical
 probabilities, maybe because they are not used to estimating the probability
 of their occurence and they feel anxious about them.
 The other side of the coin is that they will under-estimate the probability
 of events that are statistically quasi-given.
 If for example I over-estimate the probability of being run down by a car
 (low probability event), then this means I underestimate the probability
 that I will cross the road safely (high probability event).
 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\ast},$
\end_inset

 which is the probability that agents are able to estimate correctly, is
 variously evaluated between 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5.$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those systematic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

errors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the perception of probabilites mean that for example, a bet offering
 5% chance of $100 may sell for $6, 50% chance may sell for $50 while 95%
 chance may sell for $93.
 EUT would find it difficult to explain how risk aversion would vary so
 much depending on the bet (the agent is first risk loving, then risk neutral,
 then risk averse).
 CPT would explain this variation with probability weighting functions.
 One would thus have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\pi(5\%)u(100)+\pi(95\%)u(0) & =u(6)\\
\pi(50\%)u(100)+\pi(50\%)u(0) & =u(50)\\
\pi(95\%)u(100)+\pi(5\%)u(0) & =u(93)
\end{align}

\end_inset

 Normalizing 
\begin_inset Formula $u(0)=0,$
\end_inset

 then one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\pi(5\%) & =u(6)/u(100)\\
\pi(50\%) & =u(50)/u(100)\\
\pi(95\%) & =u(93)/u(100)

 CPT differs from RDEUT by taking into account whether the event is considered
 as a loss or as a gain.
 This is intuitively justified by saying that losses affect the agent more
 than gains, and are thus overweighted.
 The distinction between `gain' and `losses' is of course subjective, and
 must be calibrated depending on the individual and the situation.
 An alternative way to consider gains and losses is to assign different
 utility functionals to gains compared to losses, whereby agents are almost
 risk neutral with respect to gain (for example, a 
\begin_inset Formula $50/50$
\end_inset

 chance to gain 
\begin_inset Formula $\$100$
\end_inset

 would be evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $\$49$
\end_inset

), while being very risk averse with respect to losses (for example, a 
\begin_inset Formula $50/50$
\end_inset

 chance to lose 
\begin_inset Formula $\$100$
\end_inset

 would be evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $-\$60$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the agent is ready to pay 
\begin_inset Formula $\$60$
\end_inset

 not to play the lottery).

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, given the complexity of the arguments, it is rather difficult
 to make intuitive reasonings to justify the precise shape of the indifference
 curves.
 Consider however the indifference curve corresponding to utility 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{2}.$
\end_inset

 If the agent was an EU maximizer, then its indifference curve would take
 the form of the dotted line.
 On the hypothenuse, one considers a lottery with equal probability between
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C,$
\end_inset

 which the agent evaluates as in EUT (if one assumes 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\ast}=0.5)$
\end_inset

.
 On the line joining 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C,$
\end_inset

 one has a lottery with a better outcome with high probability, which is
 going to be under-evaluated, which explains the indifference curve is above
 the EU curve with the corresponding utility.
 However, the under-evaluation is not so high since the probability of the
 best event is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.$
\end_inset

 As the probability of that best event increases, so does the discrepancy,
 until a point where the discrepancy decreases again as the lotteries involve
 closer outcomes.
 The indifference curves are thus concave.

\begin_layout Subsection
Regret theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regret theory differs from the above theories because it does not obtain
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $`$
\end_inset

utility function' but rather, a gain/loss function that evaluates by how
 much choosing a lottery over another and then comparing their outcome is
 expected to make one happy/unhappy.
 To the difference of other theories, regret theory explicitly takes into
 account the opportunity cost of making a decision.
 Decisions are not taken in a vacuum; making one decision precludes making
 another one.
 The theory is exposed in Loomes and Sugden (82, 86)

 Agents thus faced with alternative lotteries do not seek to maximize expected
 utility but rather to minimize expected regret (or maximize expected rejoicing)
 from their choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formally, suppose lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 has probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $(p_{1},..,p_{n})$
\end_inset

 while lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{1},..,q_{n})$
\end_inset

 over the same finite set of outcomes 
\begin_inset Formula $x=(x_{1},...,x_{n})$
\end_inset

.
 Expected rejoice/regret from choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E(r(p,q))=\underset{i}{\sum}\underset{j}{\sum}p_{i}q_{j}r(x_{i},x_{j})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}q_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the probability of outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 in lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 in lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 will be chosen over lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $E(r(p,q))$
\end_inset

 is positive and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 will be chosen over 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $E(r(p,q))$
\end_inset

 is negative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if 
\begin_inset Formula $r(x_{i},x_{j})=u(x_{i})-u(x_{j})$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $E(r(p,q))$
\end_inset

 is simply the difference in expected utility between lottery 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and regret theory leads to exactly the same decision as EUT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under regret theory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)$
\end_inset

 is increasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 so that the higher the good outcome, the higher the rejoicing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)=-r(y,x),$
\end_inset

 so that regret/rejoice is symmetric: Getting the good outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 rather than the bad outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 produces the same amount of rejoicing than the amount of regret induced
 by getting the symmetric outcome.
 The expected rejoice at a gain is the same as the expected regret at a
 same sized loss,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $r(x,y)>r(x,z)+r(z,y)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $x>z>y$
\end_inset

, that is the rejoicing increases more than proportionately with the difference
 in outcome.
 I rejoice more if I gain $100 rather than $0 than the sum of rejoicing
 if I gain $50 rather than $0 and $100 rather than $50, even though the
 result is the same.
 Consider for example how French people would react if their rugby team
 beat Australia (pride, celebration), compared to how they would react if
 France beat New Zealand (the usual...), and New Zealand beat Australia (no
 one cares, at least in France, except maybe in Toulouse...).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advantage of the regret/rejoice model is that the 
\begin_inset Quotes grd
\end_inset

indifference curves
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over lotteries derived from it can be intransitive, i.e.
 yield up preference reversals.
 From the beginning of the course, we know that this means indifference
 curves can cross 
\emph on
inside
\emph default
 the M-M triangle.
 Exercise 6 in 
\begin_inset Quotes els
\end_inset

Choice under Uncertainty
\begin_inset Quotes ers
\end_inset

 shows that not only does RT allow for intransitive preferences, but it
 also mandates one specific direction in which preferences can be intransitive,
 i.e.
 while it would allow 
\begin_inset Formula $A\succ B\succ C\succ A,$
\end_inset

 it would not allow 
\begin_inset Formula $A\prec B\prec C\prec A.$
\end_inset

 This means that a test of RT is to check that intransitiveness, when it
 occurs, occurs in one direction only.
 Experiments tend to bear this out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main issue with RT is that while comparisons between two lotteries are
 relatively easy under its setting, comparisons between several lotteries
 are much more involved.
 For example, while it is easy to model the choice between (marriage, no
 marriage), it is more difficult to model the choice between (marriage,
 civil partnership, none of the above).
 Of course, one could divide the comparison between those three lotteries
 into three comparisons between two lotteries, but one then loses most of
 the point of modeling the effect of regret on lottery choices.
